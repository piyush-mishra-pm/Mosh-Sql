- Calculations on column values. Arithmetic operators precedences ( * / are higher priority than +-). So arithmetic expressions can be run in SELECT clause.
```mysql
	SELECT points, points*10+3 AS new_points
	FROM customers;
```

- Unique values in column:
```mysql
	SELECT DISTINCT states
	FROM customers;
```

- Where clause:
```mysql
	-- customers with points > 3000
	SELECT *
	FROM customers
	WHERE points > 3000;

	-- customers with points != 3000
	SELECT *
	FROM customers
	WHERE points <> 3000;
	-- WHERE points != 3000
	-- WHERE points NOT IN (3000)

	-- Using Arithmetic expressions in WHERE clause:
	SELECT *
	FROM order_items
	WHERE order_id=6 AND unit_price * quantity > 3000;
	
```

- Comparison on Dates:
```mysql
	SELECT *
	FROM Customers
	-- Default date string: YYYY-MM-DD
	WHERE birthdate > '1990-01-01';
```

- AND / OR / AND-OR together. AND operator is evaluated before OR.
```mysql
	SELECT *
	FROM customers
	
	-- AND
	WHERE birth_date > '1990-01-01' AND points > 1000;
	
	-- OR
	-- WHERE birth_date > '1990-01-01' OR points > 1000;

	-- AND OR together. (birthdate>1990 || (points>1000 && state==VA))
	-- WHERE birth_date > '1990-01-01' OR 
		-- points > 1000 AND state='VA';
	
	-- Which is equivalent to:
	-- WHERE birth_date > '1990-01-01' OR ( points > 1000 AND state='VA' );
```

- NOT operator: Sometimes demorgans laws can help simplify the expression.
```mysql
	SELECT *
	FROM customers
	-- AND, OR, NOT together:
	WHERE NOT (birth_date > '1990-01-01' OR points > 1000);	
	-- Simplifying using Demorgan's laws.
	-- WHERE birth_date <= '1990-01-01' AND points <= 1000);	
```

- IN :
```mysql
	-- 1st way, using OR
	SELECT *
	FROM customers
	WHERE state = 'VA' OR state='GA' OR state='FL';
	-- Invalid syntax below, can't chain OR on values like below.
	-- WHERE state = 'VA' OR 'GA' OR 'FL';

	-- 2nd way, using IN
	SELECT *
	FROM customers
	WHERE state IN ('VA', 'GA', 'FL');

	-- NOT IN clause: customers from states other than mentioned.
	SELECT *
	FROM customers
	WHERE state NOT IN ('VA', 'GA', 'FL');
```

- BETWEEN: Range values mentioned in BETWEEN are inclusive (so equality also considered).
```mysql
	-- 1st way:
	SELECT *
	FROM customers
	WHERE points >= 1000 AND points <= 1500;

	-- 2nd way:
	SELECT *
	FROM customers
	WHERE points BETWEEN 1000 AND 1500;
```

- LIKE : Pattern matching on strings. Case insensitive.
```mysql
	-- Last names beginning with b or B.
	SELECT *
	FROM customers
	WHERE last_name LIKE 'b%';
	-- Using NOT with LIKE:
	-- WHERE last_name NOT LIKE 'b%';

	-- SOME LIKE patterns:
	-- '%' -> Any number of characters
	-- '_' -> Single character.
	
	-- Last names containing b or B (in beginning, middle or end).
	'%b%'
	
	-- Last names ending with b or B.
	'%b'
	
	-- Last names with only 2 chars, and ends with b or B.
	'_b'
```

- REGEXP: More powerful than LIKE.
```mysql
	SELECT *
	FROM customers
	-- last_name contains 'field'. No percent sign required.
	WHERE last_name REGEXP 'field';

	-- SOME REGEXP patterns:
	-- '^a' -> strings beginning with 'a'
	-- 'a$' -> strings ending wih 'a'
	-- 'name1|name2' -> strings containing 'name1' or 'name2' in last_name.
	-- '^field|mac|rose$' -> strings starting with 'field', or containing 'mac' or ending with 'rose'.
	-- '[gim]e' -> strings containing 'ge', or 'ie', or 'me'.
	-- '[a-z]e' -> strings containing 'ae', or 'be', or 'ce', .... or 'ze'.

	-- SUMMARY: Common REGEX patterns.
	-- ^ beginning
	-- $ end
	-- | or
	-- [abc] multiple search patterns.
	-- [a-f]
```

- IS NULL : Look for records with missing values.
```mysql
-- IS NULL
	SELECT *
	FROM customers	
	WHERE phone IS NULL;

-- IS NOT NULL
	SELECT *
	FROM customers	
	WHERE phone IS NOT NULL;
```

- ORDER BY :  ASC by default.
```mysql
-- sorted in DESC.
	SELECT *
	FROM customers	
	ORDER BY first_name DESC;

-- sort by multiple columns. (state- ASC, first_name- DESC).
	SELECT *
	FROM customers	
	ORDER BY state, first_name DESC;

-- in MySQL we can sort even by columns which are not in select clause.
	SELECT user_id, user_age
	FROM customers	
	ORDER BY state, first_name DESC;

-- sort by alias:
	SELECT first_name, 10 AS points
	FROM customers
	ORDER BY points, first_name;

-- sort by column positions: Avoid this approach, as if you add a column in future in select, then you will need to update the indices in order clause.
	SELECT first_name, last_name
	FROM customers
	-- sorted by first_name, last_name
	ORDER BY 1, 2;

-- sort by arithmetic expression:
	SELECT *, quantity * unit_price
	FROM order_items
	WHERE order_id = 2
	ORDER BY quantity * unit_price DESC;

-- sort by alias of an expression:
	SELECT *, quantity * unit_price AS total_price
	FROM order_items
	WHERE order_id = 2
	ORDER BY total_price DESC;
```

- LIMIT : skip, limit. If limit >= number of records, then we get all the records.
```mysql
-- first 3 customers
	SELECT *
	FROM customers	
	LIMIT 3;

-- Skip/Offset for pagination.
	SELECT *
	FROM customers	
	-- LIMIT skip,limit;
	LIMIT 6,3;
	-- gives: 7th, 8th, & 9th entry.

-- LIMIT clause usually comes towards the end. See the order as follows:
	SELECT 
	FROM
	WHERE
	ORDER BY
	LIMIT
```
