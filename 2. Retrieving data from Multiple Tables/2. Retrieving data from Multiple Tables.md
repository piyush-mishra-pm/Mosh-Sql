- **INNER JOIN :** JOIN two tables. INNER JOIN is default JOIN, and can hence just write JOIN.
```mysql
-- Joining orders and customers tables on customer_id.
-- If all columns selected, then result will have first columns mentioned from orders table, and then mentions columns from customers table.
	SELECT *
	FROM orders
	JOIN customers
		ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;

-- If column name selected, then if that column is present in both the tables,
-- then a AMBIGUOUS column name error occurs. So prefix such common columns name with correct table name.

-- ALIAS for table names:
	SELECT order_id, o.customer_id, first_name, last_name
	FROM orders o
	JOIN customers c
		ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
-- If you have used a tables alias anywhere, then you have to use that table alias everywhere.
-- So you cannot mention order alias as o at one place and refer to column as order.customer_id. Instead, write o.customer_id.
```

- **Using multiple databases :** 1 database contains a table, and another database contains another table. We can join both as follows. You only need to reference the databases which are not currently in 'use' database.
```mysql
-- assume two databases and their tables as follows:
-- DB: sql_store, Table: sql_store.order_items;
-- DB: sql_inventory, Table: sql_inventory.products;
	SELECT *
	FROM sql_store.order_items oi
	JOIN sql_inventory.products p
		ON oi.product_id = p.product_id;

-- ALTER: use 1 DB:
	USE sql_store;
	
	SELECT *
	FROM order_items oi
	JOIN sql_inventory.products p
		ON oi.product_id = p.product_id;
```

- **Self - Joins:** Uses JOIN on same table, and requires different aliases of the same table to specify column names (which totally common in both, as they belong to same table).
```mysql
-- Join employees table to show their managers (who are also employees).
-- Note that you won't see the manager's row here, because there is no manager for the manager. Can achieve that using Self-Outer-Joins (see Self-Outer-Joins section below).
	SELECT 
		e.employee_id, 
		e.first_name AS employee
		m.first_name AS manager
	FROM employees e
	JOIN employees m
		ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id;
```

- **Joining multiple tables:** Joining >2 tables. 
```mysql
-- Will show columns from orders table, then customers table, then order_statuses table.
	SELECT * 
	FROM orders o
	JOIN customers c
		ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
	JOIN order_statuses os
		ON o.status = os.order_status_id;

-- Narrowing down the columns:
	SELECT 
		o.order_id,
		o.order_date,
		c.first_name,
		c.last_name,
		os.name AS status
	FROM orders o
	JOIN customers c
		ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
	JOIN order_statuses os
		ON o.status = os.order_status_id;
```

- **Compound Join conditions:** What if you can't use single column to identify and join records in two tables? Then try using a combination of columns to uniquely identify a record, and then perform a join. This is a case of COMPOSITE PRIMARY KEY.
```mysql
-- Using two columns: order_id and product_id to join two tables.
	SELECT *
	FROM order_items oi
	JOIN order_item_notes oin
		ON 
			oi.order_id = oin.order_id
			AND
			oi.product_id = oin.product_id;
```

- **Implicit Join syntax:** Writing table names together in FROM, and using WHERE clause for matching columns, instead of JOIN ON. But prefer writing Explicit syntax, as it throws error if joining columns missed, whereas implicit syntax just performs Cross Joins.
```mysql
-- 1st way: (SAFER) Explicit Join syntax
	SELECT *
	FROM orders o
	JOIN customers c
	-- syntax error if you miss the below ON clause.
		ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;

-- 2nd way: (Riskier) IMPLICIT JOIN syntax
	SELECT *
	FROM orders o, customers c
	WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id;

-- CROSS-JOIN: if you forget to put WHERE clause then gets a CROSS JOIN.
-- Preferably avoid Implicit Join Syntax.
	SELECT *
	FROM orders o, customers c;
	-- gives len(o) * len(c) number of rows. This is the cross product.
	-- gives no syntax error.

```

- **Outer Joins:** 
	- LEFT join allows right table to have nulls, RIGHT join allows left table to have nulls. 
	- LEFT join returns all records of left table, whether the ON clause condition is true or not (in inner join case, if null on either side of ON clause condition, then it is false and hence record is not returned). 
	- You don't need to type LEFT OUTER JOIN, just write LEFT JOIN.
```mysql
-- Lets write an Inner join and then convert it to outer join.

-- Inner Join version: Result shows only those customers which actually have an order. So if a customer has no order, then those customers are not in result.
	SELECT 
		c.customer_id,
		c.first_name,
		o.order_id
	FROM customers c
	JOIN orders o
		-- following comparison is not applicable with null on either side.
		-- this happens when there is no order for the customer.
		ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id 
	ORDER BY c.customer_id;

-- What if you want all the customers, regardless of orders or not?
-- OUTER Join
-- 1. Left Outer Join
	SELECT 
		c.customer_id,
		c.first_name,
		o.order_id
	FROM customers c
	-- all the records from the left table (customers) will be used, even if  the right table (orders) has NULL.
	LEFT JOIN orders o
		ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id 
	ORDER BY c.customer_id;

-- 2. Right Outer Join
	SELECT 
		c.customer_id,
		c.first_name,
		o.order_id
	FROM customers c
	-- all the records from the right table (orders) will be used, even if  the right table (customers) has NULL. So get records of all the orders, regardless of a no customer for an existing order.
	RIGHT JOIN orders o
		ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id 
	ORDER BY c.customer_id;

-- Verbose syntax:
	LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN
-- Shorter syntax:
	LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN

-- Consecutive left joins between multiple tables:
	SELECT 
		c.customer_id,
		c.first_name,
		o.order_id,
		sh.name AS shipper
	FROM customers c
	-- get all the customers, regardless of having orders or not.
	LEFT JOIN orders o
		ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
	-- get all the orders, regardless of having order shippers or not.
	LEFT JOIN shippers sh
		ON o.shipper_id = sh.shipper_id
	ORDER BY c.customer_id;

-- For code readability and simplicity, when joining multiple tables, avoid doing multiple Left, Right, Inner joins in a single query.
-- BAD QUERY, avoid this.
	SELECT 
		c.customer_id,
		c.first_name,
		o.order_id,
		sh.name AS shipper
	FROM customers c
	-- get all the orders, regardless of having customers or not.
	RIGHT JOIN orders o
		ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
	-- get all the orders, regardless of having order shippers or not.
	LEFT JOIN shippers sh
		ON o.shipper_id = sh.shipper_id
	ORDER BY c.customer_id;
```

- **Self Outer Joins:** 
```mysql
	SELECT 
		e.employee_id, 
		e.first_name AS employee
		m.first_name AS manager
	FROM employees e
	-- get all the employees whether they have a manager of not.
	-- helps use get eveb manager's row as manager doesn't have any manager.
	LEFT JOIN employees m
		ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id;
```

- **USING:** If column name is same in both the tables being joined, then can use shorter syntax by USING. Can be used with both inner and outer joins. Can also perform Compound joins using multiple columns.
```mysql
	SELECT * 
	FROM orders o
	JOIN customers c
		USING (customer_id)
	LEFT JOIN shippers sh
		USING (shipper_id);

-- COMPOSITE Primary key, used in compound joins:
-- Verbose by avoiding USING
	SELECT *
	FROM order_items oi
	JOIN order_item_notes oin
		ON 
			oi.order_id = oin.order_id
			AND
			oi.product_id = oin.product_id;

-- Concise by using USING
	SELECT *
	FROM order_items oi
	JOIN order_item_notes oin
		USING(order_id,product_id;
		
```

- **NATURAL JOINS:** Database engine will look for common column names and then perform a join. We don't explicitly specify column names to use to join. Can be easy to code, but can produce unexpected results as DB gets freedom to decide the same name columns to use to perform joins. Avoid using Natural joins.
```mysql
	SELECT * 
	FROM orders o
	NATURAL JOIN customers c;
```

- **CROSS JOINS:** Combine every record of one table with every record of another table.  Prefer using explicit syntax, than implicit syntax.
```mysql
-- Generate all combinations of sizes and colors.

-- 1. Explicit Syntax Cross Join:
	SELECT
		s.size_number AS size,
		c.color_name AS color		
	FROM sizes s
	CROSS JOIN colors c
	ORDER BY c.color_name;

-- 2. Implicit Syntax Cross Join:
	SELECT
		s.size_number AS size,
		c.color_name AS color		
	FROM sizes s, colors c
	ORDER BY c.color_name;

-- But prefer to use explicit syntax, as it clearly mentions the intent.
```

- **UNION:** Joins can help us combine columns from multiple tables. But how to combine rows from multiple tables? UNION. Can combine same or different tables. Ensure that the number of columns in each table are same, else error. The name of columns in resultant table is dictated by the SELECT clause written before UNION.
```mysql
-- 1. Combining results from same tables:
-- Get all the ACTIVE orders (orders in 2019), and all the Archived orders (orders before 2019).
	SELECT 
		order_id, 
		order_date,
		'ACTIVE' AS status
	FROM orders
	WHERE order_date>= '2019-01-01'
	UNION
	SELECT 
		order_id, 
		order_date,
		'ARCHIVED' AS status
	FROM orders
	WHERE order_date < '2019-01-01';

-- 2. Combining results from different tables: Result table has column name as 'first_name', as it is written before the UNION clause. Also ensure that the number of columns are same in both the select clauses on either side of Union.
	SELECT first_name
	FROM customers
	UNION
	SELECT name
	FROM shippers;

	-- Error, as number of columns are not same in SELECT clauses present on either side of UNION:
	SELECT first_name, last_name
	FROM customers
	UNION
	SELECT name
	FROM shippers

-- Exercise: check customer points and assign them a type:BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD. Sort the result using customer's first name.
	SELECT 
		customer_id, 
		first_name, 
		points, 
		'BRONZE' AS type
	FROM customers
	WHERE points < 2000

	UNION

	SELECT 
		customer_id, 
		first_name, 
		points, 
		'SILVER' AS type
	FROM customers
	WHERE 2000 <= points <= 3000

	UNION

	SELECT 
		customer_id, 
		first_name, 
		points, 
		'GOLD' AS type
	FROM customers
	WHERE 3000 < points

	ORDER BY first_name;	
```
