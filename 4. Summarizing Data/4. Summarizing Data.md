- **Aggregate Functions :** Not limited to numeric values only. Can also use on dates and strings. Aggregate functions only run on non-NULL values. non Null values are not aggregated. If also need to aggregate on null values, then use. Use DISTINCT if want to avoid duplicate values.
	- MAX()
	- MIN()
	- AVG()
	- SUM()
	- COUNT()

```mysql
-- On numeric valued columns.
	SELECT 
		MAX(invoice_total) AS highest,
		MIN(invoice_total) AS lowest,
		AVG(invoice_total) AS average		
	FROM invoices;

-- On non numeric valued columns.
	SELECT 
		MAX(payment_date) AS last_paid_date,
	FROM invoices;

-- SUM and COUNT:
	SELECT 
		SUM(invoice_total) AS total,
		COUNT(invoice_total) AS number_of_invoices
		COUNT(payment_date) AS count_of_payments
	FROM invoices;

-- Aggregation only on non-null values: count_of_payments has count of only concluded payments, and doesnot include payments which are pending to be paid.
	SELECT 
		COUNT(payment_date) AS count_of_payments
	FROM invoices;

-- If Aggregation required also on Null values, then use *.
	SELECT 
		COUNT(*) AS total_records
	FROM invoices;

-- Writing expression inside aggregate functions:
-- execution order: first get all invoice_total values, then multiply 1.1 to each, then aggregate by summing these values.
	SELECT 
		SUM(invoice_total * 1.1) AS total
	FROM invoices;

-- Aggregate functions follow filtering criterias (WHERE).
	SELECT 
		SUM(invoice_total * 1.1) AS total
	FROM invoices
	WHERE invoice_date > '2019-01-01';

-- DISTINCT (not include duplicate values in calculation). By default, Aggregate functions do include duplicate values in calculations.
	SELECT 
		COUNT(DISTINCT client_id) AS total_unique_clients
	FROM invoices;	
```

- Q. **Exercise**: generate following table from invoices:

| date_range  | total_sales | total_payments | what_we_expect |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| First half of 2019 | 1539.07 | 662.69 | 876.38 |
| Second half of 2019 | 1051.53 | 355.02 | 695.51|
| Total | 2590.60 | 1017.711 | 1572.89 |

```mysql
	SELECT
		'First half of 2019' AS date_range,
		SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales,
		SUM(payment_total) AS total_payments,
		SUM(invoice_total - payment_total) AS what_we_expect
	FROM invoices
	WHERE invoice_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-06-30'
	
	UNION

	SELECT
		'Second half of 2019' AS date_range,
		SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales,
		SUM(payment_total) AS total_payments,
		SUM(invoice_total - payment_total) AS what_we_expect
	FROM invoices
	WHERE invoice_date BETWEEN '2019-07-01' AND '2019-12-31'

	UNION

	SELECT
		'Total' AS date_range,
		SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales,
		SUM(payment_total) AS total_payments,
		SUM(invoice_total - payment_total) AS what_we_expect
	FROM invoices
	WHERE invoice_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31';
```

- **Group By :** 
```mysql
-- To see total sales, in second half of 2019, per client, descending order.
	SELECT
		client_id,
		SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
	FROM invoices
	WHERE invoice_date BETWEEN '2019-07-01' AND '2019-12-31'
	GROUP BY client_id
	ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

-- Remember the order of clauses:
	SELECT
	FROM
	JOIN
	WHERE
	GROUP BY
	ORDER BY -- (can't put order by before group by)
```

- Q. Exercise: Generate following table.

| state | city | total_sales |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WV | Huntington | 990.78 |
| CA | San Francisco | 700 |
| WV | Frankfurt | 89 |
| OR | Portland | 60 |

```mysql
-- group by multiple columns:
-- calculating sum of invoice totals for each state and city, in second half of year, in descending order of total sales.
	SELECT
		state, 
		city,
		SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
	FROM invoices
	JOIN clients USING (client_id)
	WHERE invoice_date BETWEEN '2019-07-01' AND '2019-12-31'
	GROUP BY state, city
	ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

- **HAVING :**  Filter results after grouping. 
	- Grouped results cannnot be filtered by WHERE clause, as where happens before grouping. So to filter after grouping, we need HAVING clause. 
	- Note that, columns used for HAVING clause, need to be present in the SELECT clause. However, WHERE columns need not be present in the SELECT clause. 
	- Rule of thumb, when having multiple columns in select clause, and using an aggregate function in select clause, then try to GROUP BY using all the non-aggregate function SELECT columns.
```mysql
-- To see total sales of > 500, in second half of 2019, per client, descending order.
	SELECT
		client_id,
		SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
	FROM invoices
	WHERE invoice_date BETWEEN '2019-07-01' AND '2019-12-31'
	GROUP BY client_id
	HAVING total_sales > 500
	ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

-- Compound filtering conditions using HAVING: To see records where total sales > 500 and invoices>5, in second half of 2019, per client, descending order.
	SELECT
		client_id,
		SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales,
		COUNT(*) AS number_of_invoices
	FROM invoices
	WHERE invoice_date BETWEEN '2019-07-01' AND '2019-12-31'
	GROUP BY client_id
	HAVING -- columns used in HAVING clause, needs to be a part of select clause.
		total_sales > 500 
		AND
		number_pf_invoices > 5
	ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

-- HAVING clause columns need to be present in the SELECT clause. Following gives an error.
	SELECT
		client_id,
		SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales,
		COUNT(*) AS number_of_invoices
	FROM invoices
	WHERE payment_date > '1990-01-01' -- NO-ERROR: WHERE columns need not be present in SELECT.
	GROUP BY client_id
	HAVING payment_date > '1990-01-01'; -- ERROR! Column not present in SELECT.

-- Remember the order of clauses:
	SELECT
	FROM
	JOIN
	WHERE -- filter before grouping.
	GROUP BY
	HAVING -- filter after grouping.
	ORDER BY -- (can't put order by before group by)
```
- Q. Exercise: Get the customers:
		- Located in Virginia
		- Who have spent > $100
```mysql
-- Rule of thumb, when having multiple columns in select clause, and using an aggregate function in select clause, then try to GROUP BY using all the non-aggregate function SELECT columns.
	SELECT
		c.customer_id,
		c.first_name,
		c.last_name,
		SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS total_sales
	FROM customers c
	JOIN orders o USING (customer_id)
	JOIN order_items oi USING (order_id)
	WHERE state = 'VA'
	-- grouping using all the non-aggregate function SELECT columns.
	GROUP BY 
		c.customer._id, 
		c.first_name, 
		c.last_name
	HAVING total_sales > 100;
```

- **Roll Up :** 
	- MYSQL only, not standard SQL. 
	- Gives an extra row summarizing the results. 
	- RollUp applies only to columns which aggregate values. 
	- When gouping by using multiple columns, then RollUp gives aggregate results for each group and then summary of all groups together. 
	- ROLLUP column name cannot be an alias, but has to be the actual name.
```mysql
	SELECT
		client_id,
		SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
	FROM invoices
	GROUP BY client_id WITH ROLLUP;

-- When grouped using multiple columns.
	SELECT
		state,
		city,
		SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
	FROM invoices i
	JOIN clients c USING (client_id)
	GROUP BY state, city WITH ROLLUP;
-- result is as follows:
```
| state | city | total_sales |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CA | San Francisco | 705.2 |
| CA | LA | 13.4 |
| CA | ```NULL``` | 718.6 |
| OR | Portland | 70.1 |
| OR | ```NULL``` | 70.1 |
| ```NULL``` | ```NULL``` | 788.7 |

```mysql
-- ROLLUP column name cannot be an alias.
-- Following gives Error:
	SELECT
		pm.name AS payment_method,
		SUM(amount) AS total
	FROM payments p
	JOIN payment_methods pm
		ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
	GROUP BY payment_method WITH ROLLUP;

-- Following is OK:
	SELECT
		pm.name AS payment_method,
		SUM(amount) AS total
	FROM payments p
	JOIN payment_methods pm
		ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
	GROUP BY pm.name WITH ROLLUP;
```
