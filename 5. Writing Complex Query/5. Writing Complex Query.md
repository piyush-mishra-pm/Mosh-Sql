- **Subquery :** SQL query within query. Subquery can return a single value, a list of values, or even a table with multiple columns. Can be written in SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc. clauses.
- **Subquery in WHERE clause**:

```mysql
-- Find products that are more expensive than Lettuce (id=3)
	SELECT *
	FROM products
	WHERE unit_price > (
		SELECT unit_price
		FROM products
		WHERE product_id = 3
	);
	-- order of execution in above query: First subquery (inner query) is evaluated, then result is passed to outer query.

-- Exercise: Find employees who earn more than average:
	SELECT *
	FROM employees
	WHERE employee_salary > (
		SELECT AVG(employee_salary)
		FROM products
	);


```

- **Subquery  using IN:** When subquery results a list of values, we can use IN clause to check outer query wrt list of results returned from inner query.

```mysql
-- Find products that have never been ordered:
	SELECT *
	FROM products 
	WHERE product_id NOT IN(
		SELECT DISTINCT product_id
		FROM order_items
	);

-- Find clients without invoices:
	SELECT *
	FROM clients
	WHERE client_id NOT IN (
		SELECT DISTINCT client_id
		FROM invoices
	);
```

- **Subquery vs Join :** Depends upon performance and readability. If two approaches have same performance, then prioritise readability.
```mysql
-- Subquery method: Find clients without invoices:
	SELECT *
	FROM clients
	WHERE client_id NOT IN (
		SELECT DISTINCT client_id
		FROM invoices
	);

-- Join method: Find clients without invoices:
	SELECT *
	FROM clients
	LEFT JOIN invoices USING (client_id)
	WHERE invoice_id IS NULL;

-- Here, readablity wise, subquery method is better for the asked question.

-- Problem 2: Find customers who have ordered lettuce (id=3).
-- Subquery method : Less readability:
	SELECT *
	FROM customers
	WHERE customer_id IN (
		SELECT o.customer_id
		FROM order_items oi
		JOIN orders o USING (order_id)
		WHERE product_id = 3
	);
-- Join method : More readability:
	SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, first_name, last_name
	FROM customers c
	JOIN orders o USING (customer_id)
	JOIN order_items oi USING(order_id)
	WHERE oi.product_id = 3;

-- Here Join method seems more readable.
```

- **ALL :** 

```mysql
-- Select all invoices larger than all invoices of client 3:
	SELECT *
	FROM invoices
	WHERE invoice_total > (
		SELECT MAX(invoice_total)
		FROM invoices
		WHERE client_id = 3
	);
	-- subquery above has resulted in only a single value, and we only need to compare every row with a single value.

-- Alter using ALL:
	SELECT *
	FROM invoices
	WHERE invoice_total > ALL ( --  WHERE invoice_total > ALL (150,123,170, ...)
		SELECT invoice_total
		FROM invoices
		WHERE client_id = 3
	);
	-- in above query MySQL will compare invoice_total of each row with all of the values in list (150, 130, 167, ...). The subquery here has returned a list of values.

-- If skipped ALL keyword, then MySQL will not be able to compare in WHERE clause. MySQL will not know how to compare a row with a list of values.
	SELECT *
	FROM invoices
	WHERE invoice_total > ( --  WHERE invoice_total > (150,123,170, ...)
		SELECT invoice_total
		FROM invoices
		WHERE client_id = 3
	);

```

- **ANY :**  'IN' is the same as '= ANY'
```mysql
-- Select clients with atleast two invoices.
	SELECT *
	FROM clients
	WHERE client_id IN (
		SELECT client_id, COUNT(*) as num_invoices
		FROM invoices
		GROUP BY client_id
		-- HAVING num_invoices > 1 -- Cannot write this line as it has alias.
		HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
	);
-- Alter with ANY:
	SELECT *
	FROM clients
	WHERE client_id = ANY(
		SELECT client_id
		FROM invoices
		GROUP BY client_id
		HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
	);
```

- **Correlated Subqueries :**  Can be slow, as executed for each row.

```mysql
-- Select employees whose salary is above average in their office. Each office has some employees, and there are different offices, with different number of employees in the table. Average is not constant for the whole table.

-- pseudocode:
-- foreach employee
	-- calculate the avg salary for employee.office
	-- return the employee if salary > avg

	SELECT *
	FROM employees e
	WHERE salary > (
		SELECT AVG(salary)
		FROM employees
		WHERE office_id = e.office_id
	);
	-- we use the same employee table in outer and inner tables.
	-- correlation of inner query with outer query. Earlier whatever queries we wrote were un-correlated query (and MySQL runs them only once).

-- example of an uncorrelated query: Inner query run only once.
-- select clients with atleast two indices.
	SELECT *
	FROM clients
	WHERE client_id IN (
		SELECT client_id
		FROM invoices
		GROUP BY client_id
		HAVING COUNT(*)>=2
	);

-- Get invoices that are larger than the client's average invoice amount. A client can have multiple invoices. Calculate for each employee the average invoice amount, then return the client invoices > client avg invoice amount.
	SELECT *
	FROM invoices i
	WHERE invoice_total > (
		SELECT AVG(invoice_total)
		FROM invoices
		WHERE client_id = i.client_id
	);
```

- **EXISTS** : a correlated sub query, however, it only checks that if there exists a matching record. It doesnot populate the whole results of the subquery. Better than IN clause, which uses a list of results from subquery. So if the Subquery of IN results a huge list, then perhaps it is better to use EXISTS operator.
```mysql
-- Select clients that have an invoice.
-- 3 approaches: IN, JOIN, EXISTS

-- 1. IN:
	SELECT *
	FROM clients
	WHERE client_id IN ( -- WHERE client_id IN (1,2,3,5, .... )
		SELECT DISTINCT client_id
		FROM invoices
	);

-- 2. JOIN: Inner join between clients and invoice, and thus you will only get clients having an invoice.

-- 3. EXISTS:
	SELECT *
	FROM clients c
	WHERE EXISTS(
		SELECT client_id
		FROM invoices
		WHERE client_id = c.client_id
	);

-- Find the products that have never been ordered:
-- 1. NOT IN approach
	SELECT *
	FROM products
	WHERE product_id NOT IN (
		SELECT product_id
		FROM order_items
	);
-- 2. NOT EXISTS approach
	SELECT *
	FROM products p
	WHERE product_id NOT EXISTS (
		SELECT product_id
		FROM order_items
		WHERE product_id = p.product_id
	);
```

- **Sub-queries in Select clause** : consider a table as result of following query.

| invoice_id | invoice_total | invoice_average | difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 101.79 | 152.388 | -50.59 |
| 2 | 175.32 | 152.388 | 22.93 |
| 3 | 147.99 | 152.388 | -4.39 |

```mysql
	SELECT 
		invoice_id,
		invoice_total,
		-- calculating avg of all invoices from invoices table.
		(SELECT AVG(invoice_total)
			FROM invoices) AS invoice_average
		
		-- could not calculate expression with a column alias (invoice_average)
		-- invoice_total - invoice_average

		-- we can repeat the query here, and it would work, but we are then repeating the query, and is hard to read too.
		-- invoice_total - (SELECT AVG(invoice_total) FROM invoices)

		-- lastly, we can access the alias column as a subquery.
		invoice_total - (SELECT invoice_average) AS difference		
	FROM invoices;
```

Exercise:  Write query to produce following result.

| client_id | name | total_sales | average | difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Vinte | 802.89 | 152.388 | 650.50 |
| 2 | Myworks | 101.80 | 152.388 | -50.59 |
| 3 | Yadel | 705.9 | 152.388 | 553.511 |
| 4 | Kwideo | ```NULL``` | 152.388 | ```NULL```  |
| 5 | Topiclounge | 980.02 | 152.388 | 827.631 |
```mysql
-- solution to above question:
	SELECT
		client_id,
		name,
		(
			SELECT SUM(invoice_total)
			FROM invoices
			WHERE client_id = c.client_id
		) AS total_sales,
		(
			SELECT AVG(invoice_total) FROM invoices
		) AS average,
		(
			SELECT total_sales - average
		) AS difference
	FROM clients c;
```

- **Sub-queries in From clause** : 
	- When using sub-queries in the from clause, then it is mandatory to use the alias for the subquery. 
	- Filtering is also possible here, as subquery generates a virtual table (a new table which can referenced in FROM as any other table). 
	- We can also JOIN this with other table. 
	- Problem is that it complicates the main query code. This can resolved using VIEWS, like storing this result in a View in DB. This can help simplify our queries.
	- So because of complicated query generated due to FROM clause subqueries, try to reserve it for simple sub-queries.
```mysql
	SELECT *
	
	FROM (
		SELECT
			client_id,
			name,
			(
				SELECT SUM(invoice_total)
				FROM invoices
				WHERE client_id = c.client_id
			) AS total_sales,
			(
				SELECT AVG(invoice_total) FROM invoices
			) AS average,
			(
				SELECT total_sales - average
			) AS difference
		FROM clients c
	) AS sales_summary

	WHERE total_sales IS NOT NULL;
```
